# Path Visualizer

Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a given start and end node,
with walls in between drawn by the user. This project has been deployed using Heroku

## This project is built using:
 - ReactJS
 - CSS(No libraries used)
 - Vanilla Javascript(To implement the dijkstra algorithm)

## 1: Choosing walls in the grid by clicking and dragging on empty cells
